## 🔄 Jun 26 — Brev cloud setup

**Goal:** Get Isaac Sim running without a local NVIDIA GPU.

**Status:** In progress · Jun 26, 2026

Isaac Sim requires an NVIDIA RTX GPU — running on Intel Iris Xe on Mac locally, so set up NVIDIA Brev cloud to spin up a GPU instance on demand. This is the recommended path for developers without local RTX hardware.

- Created NVIDIA Brev account
- Located Isaac Sim 6.0.0 with ROS2 Jazzy launchable (L40S GPU · $2.27/hr)
- Connected to noVNC desktop successfully
- Confirmed Isaac Sim and Kit are installed on the instance
- Full deployment and coursework begins TBD

## 🔄 Jun 26 — TBD — OpenUSD Certification

**Goal:** Understand the foundational language of the entire Physical AI stack.

**Status:** In progress · Started Jun 26, 2026

OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description) is the file format and framework that underpins Omniverse, Isaac Sim, and every robot and simulation asset in the Physical AI ecosystem. Originally built by Pixar for film pipelines, adopted by NVIDIA as the foundation of Omniverse.

**Key concepts:**
- Stage composition and prim hierarchy
- USD schemas and typed prims
- Referencing, layering, and composition arcs
- Python scripting with the USD API
- Why USD enables interoperability across the entire Physical AI stack

### 📊 Practice test progression

The cert requires a passing score of 80%. Here's the iterative journey to get there — each attempt identified weak areas and informed the next study session.

| Attempt | Score | Status | Key takeaway |
|---|---|---|---|
| Practice Test 1 | 58% | ❌ | Baseline — identified gaps in schema definition and composition arcs |
| Practice Test 2 | 62% | ❌ | +4% — improved on composition arcs, still weak on schema registration |
| Practice Test 3 | 67% | ❌ | +5% — schema concepts improving, gaps in USD API and layering |
| Practice Test 4 | 77% | ❌ | +10% — strong improvement, approaching passing threshold |
| Practice Test 5 | TBD | 🔄 | Targeting 80%+ |
| **Final Cert Exam** | **TBD** | **⏳** | |

> Every failed attempt was a study session in disguise — each score gap pointed directly to the next concept to revisit. 19 points gained across 4 attempts.

## ⏳ TBD — An Introduction to Developing With NVIDIA Omniverse

**Goal:** Understand how Omniverse applications are built and extended.

Omniverse is NVIDIA's platform built on top of OpenUSD — the runtime, renderer, and app ecosystem that powers Isaac Sim and the broader Physical AI stack. This course covers building a Kit-based application from a template and customizing it via extensions.

**Key concepts:**
- How `.kit` files define and assemble Omniverse applications
- Adding and configuring extensions
- How Omniverse supports OpenUSD workflows under the hood
- The relationship: OpenUSD → Omniverse → Isaac Sim

## ⏳ TBD — Isaac Sim Beginner Course

**Goal:** Get comfortable with Isaac Sim UI, scenes, and Python scripting basics before hands-on workflows.

## ⏳ TBD — Synthetic Data Generation

**Goal:** Build a data pipeline that generates training data for AI models at scale.

Synthetic data generation (SDG) is one of the most critical use cases for Physical AI — it lets you train robot models on thousands of varied scenarios without real-world data collection. Using Omniverse Replicator to randomise lighting, object placement, and camera angles.

## ⏳ TBD — Physics Simulation

**Goal:** Load a robot with real physics, sensors, and simulate its behaviour.

Physically accurate simulation is what makes Isaac Sim valuable for robotics — robots trained in simulation behave predictably in the real world because the physics match. Covers articulation, joint drives, rigid body dynamics, and sensor attachment.

## 💡 What I learned

> Updated as I go — honest reflections on the developer experience, friction points, and what other developers coming from a software background should know before starting.

| Insight | When |
|---|---|
| The `.usd` vs `.usda` distinction matters — schemas are defined in code, not scene files | Jun 26 |
| Schema registration happens at startup via plugins, not at runtime via Python scripts | Jun 26 |
| *More coming soon* | — |
